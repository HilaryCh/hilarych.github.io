You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/HilaryCh/hilarych.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
### Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
- Bulleted
- List
1. Numbered
2. List
**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
### Jekyll Themes
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HilaryCh/hilarych.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## About Me

I am a 6th-year PhD student studying geophysics and seismology. 

My research interests are

- Source characterization for small to moderate earthquakes.
-	Near-surface structure.
-	Ambient noise seismology.
-	Fiber-optic seismology.
-	Applications in reservoir and fault monitoring, geothermal exploration, and carbon storage.

In my free time, I like paddling, sailing on the Charles River, and rollerblading along the riverside.

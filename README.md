You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/HilaryCh/hilarych.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
### Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
```markdown

### Jekyll Themes
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HilaryCh/hilarych.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## About Me

I am a 6th-year PhD student studying geophysics and seismology. 

My research interests are

- Source characterization for small to moderate earthquakes.
-	Near-surface structure.
-	Ambient noise seismology.
-	Fiber-optic seismology.
-	Applications in reservoir and fault monitoring, geothermal exploration, and carbon storage.

In my free time, I like paddling, sailing on the Charles River, and rollerblading along the riverside.
